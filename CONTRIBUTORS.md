## Cloning & Testing locally

If you'd like to contribute code, running a local copy of The Deadlock Empire
should be easy:

```
git clone https://github.com/deadlockempire/deadlockempire.github.io
# open deadlockempire.github.io/index.html in a browser
```

Please use [feature branches](https://gist.github.com/vlandham/3b2b79c40bc7353ae95a) for all changes.

## Pull Request requirements

Please send any contributions in a pull request against the `devel` branch.

We will try our best to respond as quickly as we can. We would appreciate if
you could test that your contribution works and if you could use a feature
branch. Please see [Cloning and Testing locally](#cloning-and-testing-locally) 
for more information.

Since the `master` branch is automatically deployed to
[https://deadlockempire.github.io](https://deadlockempire.github.io),
we update it less frequently than `devel`. Please do not send PRs against 
the `master` branch.
