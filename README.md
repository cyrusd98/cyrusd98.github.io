Acknowledgements

We stand on the shoulders of giants.

We thank the numerous organizers, sponsors, judges and hackers of
[HackCambridge 2016](https://www.hackcambridge.com/) for the opportunity to
develop this idea and for their support.

We use [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) for manipulating the DOM and for
animations. The design is implemented using vanilla
[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). The tutorial challenge uses
[Intro.js](https://usablica.github.io/intro.js/) to familiarize the player
with the controls. Keyboard shortcuts are implemented using [Mousetrap](https://craig.is/killing/mice).

The game uses the [Amatic SC](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/amatic) font
published by [Vernon Adams](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/list/foundry/vernon-adams)
published on [Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts).

The logo is a combination of the dragon from
[the Welsh flag](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Flag_of_Wales_2.svg)
and a lock icon, both from Wikimedia Commons.
